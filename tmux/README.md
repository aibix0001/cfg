# .tmux.conf
please install:

git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm

and then start tmux with this config, it the status-bar is still 
ugly-green just press \<prefix\>+I, this usually translates to

CTRL-b I (capital "i")

tmux will then install the selected plugins and change some settings
to *my* liking - yours may differ, feel free to use other settings.
